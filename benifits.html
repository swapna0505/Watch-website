    because it allows him to keep track of time without having to pull out his phone every few minutes.

<h4 class="text-center">1. Wearing a wristwatch could save you time</h4><br>

        If you're a person who values punctuality, wearing a watch can be a great way to ensure that you're never late for an appointment. Wristwatches come in many styles, so there's one to suit every taste and budget.
